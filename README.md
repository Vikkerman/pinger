Live monitoring one or more IP adresses for Internet connection monitoring

This app is for ping 1 or more IP addresses (or webpages) in the same time at specified intervals and counting disconnections.
It something like internetconnectivitymonitor (https://code.google.com/archive/p/internetconnectivitymonitor).
You can ping your router, google and what ever you want at the same time to find where can be the problem.
